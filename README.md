# elgentos QuickAdd

Quickadd (by Elgentos) provides a rewritable configurable link to directly add products into the shopping cart. This is very useful for websites that provide affiliate feeds; it eliminates an unnecessary step in the checkout process. It directly adds the product to the cart and immediately redirects the user to the shopping cart.

The page the user is redirect to is configurable; this can be everything within the Magento installation. The module also offers the possibility to use custom success and error messages, a default quantity to be added and which prefix is to be used.

## Configuration

After installing the module, the attribute 'deeplink' is automatically created but still needs to be added to the attribute set of the products you want to give a deeplink.
